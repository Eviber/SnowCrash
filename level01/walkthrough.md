- So ! We tried to find the flag. 
- Open the file /etc/passwd
- We found a hash at the line of flag01
- We used hashcat which indicated that it's DES encryption.
- We downloaded rockyou.txt (dictionnary)
- Executed hashcat with the hash (DES) we found and the dictionnary for parameters
- TADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA :)
